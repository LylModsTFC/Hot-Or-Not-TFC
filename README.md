## Hot Or Not - TFC

Hot or Not with enhanced functionality and support for TerraFirmaCraft:
The Next Generation (TFC:TNG) for Minecraft 1.12.2.

### What does this fork have over other versions?

This fork is primarily focused around TFC integration so focused we require TFC be present in order to load.
The main pros of using this version instead of the other *two* (yes really there's two others) is that we seamlessly
integrate into the TFC metals creating Tongs for any tool metals. This means any addons which add metals such as
[Metallum](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tfc-metallum) are automatically supported! We have much more
extensive configuration, allowing you to configure the damage rate of our items, add your own entries (which are
automatically synced to the client guaranteeing tooltip are accurate).

Like the other two forks we integrate with TFC's item heat system allowing items which are heated through TFC devices
such as a Fire Pit or Forge to be considered for our handling. There is also a configuration option for automatically
replacing broken Tongs or Mitts, these must be present in the player inventory of course.
